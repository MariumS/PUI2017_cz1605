Good work Chenrui, 
Your hypothesis test was stated correctly and you have the data formulated in a way that you can test it. The only thing I would add is to plot your data using the ratio of weekday to weekend in addition to viewing the ratio by weekday since that is more related to your hypothesis.

A test that I would recommend is the z test using proportions. This is because you are comparing two ratios whose values can range from 0 to 1. Another interesting hypothesis you could test is whether customers have longer riders than subscribers. Good luck!
