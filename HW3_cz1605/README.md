For the assignment1:

    I choose the distributions of Chisquare、Poisson、Normal、Binomial、Geometric and for each of the 5 distributions I creat 3 figures.
    
    Figure1: distribution of 100 sample(mean=100)
    Figure2: distribution of sample mean
    Figure3: hist of sample mean
    
For the assignment2:
    Null Hypothesis:The ratio of Subscribers biking on weekends over Subscribers biking on weekdays is the same or higher than the ratio of                     Customers biking over weekends to Customers biking on weekdays.
    The significance level is 0.05 which means i want the probability of getting a result at least as significant as mine to be less then        5%.
    I'm using the data of citibike in 201705.
    
    1. I open the csv. ( I ask Zhiao Zhou about how to use zipfile command to download and open data)
    2. I choose the data of usertype and starttime(renamed to time).
    3. I plot 3 figures:
       (1).Distribution of Citibike bikers by usertype in May 2017, absolute counts
       (2).Distribution of Citibike bikers by usertype in May 2017, absolute counts, with statistical errors
       (3).Distribution of Citibike bikers by usertype in May 2017, normalized

For the assignment3:
    Null Hypothesis:The new commute time is the same or larger as the old commute time
    
    1. Open csv and get data.
    2. Calculate z-score and compare it to 1.96.
    3. Reject H0 which means the new commute time is less than the old commute time.
